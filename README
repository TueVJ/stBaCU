Attempting to clean up Morten's code dealing with storage simulations.

Project files:
policies.py: Main functions for creating storage time series from mismatch time series.
policy_helpers.py: Helper functions for the above.
utils.py: Ditto.

mpolicies.py: Old entries for policies. Load this if you a using legacy code.

mplot.py, mfunc.py,constant.py : Old plotting code kept around for posterity's sake.
tplot.py, tfunc.py: New plots.

wavelet_smoother.py: Wavelet smoother util. Implements pywt.
EVT_estimators.py: What it says. used for estimating estreme values of uncorrelated data.

countries.py: paths for time series and code to handle loading multiple countries.

NOTE: European countries are currently commented out and only EU_detrended is loaded to allow for faster loading. To re-enable individual countries, remove the multi-line comment """...""" from countries.py
