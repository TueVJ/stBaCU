Attempting to clean up Morten's code dealing with storage simulations.

Initialize init.py in order to get Morten's functions available:

Project files:
init.py : Master init file.
mplot.py : Contains all plotting functions. (Morten)
mfunc.py : Helper functions. (Morten)
mpolicies.py : Functions for finding storage timeseries and levels. (Morten)
tfunc.py : Helper functions (Used with tplot.py). (Tue)
tplot.py : Plotting functions. (Tue)
countries.py : Initializes contries and contains data on which country to use for timeseries.

NOTE: European countries are currently commented out and only E_detrended is loaded to allow for faster loading. To re-enable individual countries, remove the multi-line comment """...""" from countries.py
